## What is this?

KBDSpace is a project a built using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg)

I wanted to create a full-stack web app, similar to Reddit and Twitter, to demonstrate my skills as a developer. 

Features Include:
- Home page for post browsing
- Create/Edit/Delete posts
- Commenting
- User profiles
- Dedicated post pages 
- Secure authentication and session management with Clerk
- Modern, sleek design

Here are some features that were intentionally left out as they did not fit my desired scope for the project:
- Filtering/Sorting
- Direct Messaging
- Moderation Tools

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## What did I deploy it on?

- Clerk [https://clerk.com/](https://clerk.com/)
- Planetscale [https://planetscale.com/](https://planetscale.com/)
- Upstash [https://upstash.com/](https://upstash.com/)
- Vercel [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)
